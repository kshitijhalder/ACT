Ive set up the widgets  times I want to see on my Desktop several times 
After the Mac mini goes to sleep they disappear If I try to reset them again 
the space that was occupied by the disappeared widgets is blocked from adding new widgets 
so it seems that theyre still there but not visible Im running Sonoma  on a  
Mac mini M Pro Any ideas who I can get the widgets to display on the Desktop at all times
