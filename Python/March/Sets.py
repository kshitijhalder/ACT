Sequence Types:
Sets    -   Unordered collection of unique elements
        -   Sets are written in curly brackets
        -   Sets are mutable
        -   Sets are unordered
        -   Sets do not allow duplicate values
        -   Sets are used to perform mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference and complement
        -   Sets are used to remove duplicate values from a list
        -   Sets are used to perform membership test
        -   Sets are used to remove common elements from two sets

        -   Sets are used to find the intersection of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the union of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the symmetric difference between two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the subset of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the superset of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the disjoint of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the complement of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the cartesian product of two sets
        -   Sets are used to find the power set of two sets
